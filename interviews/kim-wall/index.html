            <img src="/img/interviews/kim-wall-1.jpg" class="text-left" alt="">
            <p>Kim Wall, the lovely lady who played "Cindy" in SLEEPAWAY CAMP III: TEENAGE WASTELAND, has "dropped by" (flagpole pun intended) the website to talk camp with us. Kim has a role in the new Stephen King movie "The Mist" which opens in theaters everywhere this Thanksgiving. We are going to be shooting an in-depth video interview with Kim next year, but thought we'd give you some early Thanksgiving dessert to hold you over. Please feel free to e-mail your questions for Kim to the website, and many of them will indeed be answered in next year's video interview.
            <span class="question">How did you get involved with Sleepaway Camp 3?</span>
            I was lucky enough to get the opportunity to audition for the part with the director. They were also casting for Sleepaway Camp 2 and my boyfriend, at that time, Tony Higgins was cast in the part of Sean Whitmore. He is now a minister.</p>

            <p><span class="question">You had one of the very best death scenes in SC3. The flagpole was wild! Tell us a little bit about shooting that scene. How far in the air did you really get hoisted and what was that like?</span>
            That scene was a blast to shoot. I was wearing a body harness under my clothes. They used a crane to lift me up out of the shot. It was about 10 - 15 feet into the air. Pamela was not actually pulling the cord, she was just doing a very good job of acting like she was pulling it. I could actually see her through the bottom of the blind fold. Even though they hoisted me up high in the air, I was having too much fun to be scared. I love the sound effect of the skull hitting the ground. Very Gross!</p>

            <p><span class="question">What was it like to get a bowl of oatmeal stuffed in your face by Riff?</span>
            First off, Daryl Wilcher was sweetie pie to work with. We really hit it off. I was a little nervous, with the use of the N-word in the scene because that is not language that I use personally. Daryl made me feel very comfortable and we had fun. The oatmeal in the face was why my hair was in a ponytail for most of the movie.
            <span class="question">What are some of the things you remember most about working on Sleepaway 3?</span>
            It was my first film and a great introduction to a movie set. Everyone was nice and easy going which isn't always the case in this business. I remember saying "NO" to going topless in the scene when all of the girls are changing clothes. That is why I still had my bra on. I think the girls look a little self concious showing their boobs in that scene. But, they looked great!</p>

            <p><span class="question">Are you a fan of horror movies? And if so, what are some of your favorites?</span>
            The Others, The Sixth Sense, Resident Evil and The Scary Movie series are a few of my favorites. Most horror films give me nightmares if I watch them before I go to bed.
            <span class="question"> You currently have a role in Stephen King's THE MIST which hits theaters this week. Can you tell us about your role in the movie and what the whole experience was like for you?</span>
            My character was trapped in a grocery store with alot of people when the mist rolls in. I play a Teriffied Woman who totally loses it. Becoming terrified everyday made me very jumpy on and off the set. The slightest noise would make me flinch. This is a very intense movie, very much a horrifing situation. I don't want to tell you very much. That would spoil it for you. My recommendation is to see it before people start talking about what happens. You will be horrified! Enjoy!</p>
