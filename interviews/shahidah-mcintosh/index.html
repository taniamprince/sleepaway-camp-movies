            <p>Of all the characters you don't want to mess with at Camp Manabe, Bella would probably top your list. But the tough-as-nails troublemaker, who brings back memories of Sleepaway Camp 3's "Riff," is very much the opposite of her real life alter-ego: Shahidah McIntosh. Shahidah sits down with sleepawaycampmovies.com's JHayes to talk about her memorable role in RETURN TO SLEEPAWAY CAMP.
            <span class="question">How did you originally get involved with Return to Sleepaway Camp?</span>
            Well I was a part of the original cast. They cast the movie, then they were delayed then cast the crew again. I was apart of the original cast and they decided to keep me on.
            <span class="question">Ashley Carin, who plays "Alex", said that she was up for the part of "Bella" as well, but ultimately you won the part. Tell us about that.</span>
            During auditions I was asked to do an improv scene being a real “hard ass” as the director described it . At first I was alone, they told me the scene then they asked me to perform it. Then there was a second improv with the main character Alan. Robert wanted me to treat him like crap and get in his face. I wound up getting in his face and gripping him up against the wall. Robert liked that . Then I had a head to head audition with Ashley Carin. Ashley and I went up against each other to see who was tougher with Alan. I guess they thought I came across tougher but Ashley did a great job too.
            <span class="question">Have you seen any of the previous SLEEPAWAY CAMP movies and if so, what did you think of them?</span>
            Yes! The first one. The ending was classic and Felissa was great in it.</p>

            <p><span class="question">What was it like playing "Bella" and what do you and her share in common and differ in?</span>
            Nothing really. I really am not that abrasive. I just enjoy playing tough. I like being the heard as in the outside but really im just a big old softy.
            <span class="question">What was your favorite scene to shoot?</span>
            The lunch room scenes. They were the most layed back and everyone vibed well and in between shots we really got to know each other.
            <span class="question">What was it like working with Robert Hiltzik?</span>
            He was real cool. Layed back type guy and always had a good words of encouragment.
            <span class="question">Are you a fan of horror movies? And if so, what are some of your favorites?</span>
            Yes Yes Yes.. Im a big ol baby so I don’t like to watch them alone but I love being frightened… I have too many favs to name but SLEEPAWAY is among the top.
            <span class="question">Talk about some interesting memories (good and/or bad) you have about working on this movie.</span>
            There were a lot but the whole typing process was like actually being in summer camp. I got the chance to get to know some great people in a real fun environment.</p>

            <p><span class="question">Tell us about your work, interests, and pursuits in the entertainment world.</span>
            I want to write and act. My dream would be writing on a sitcom that I am also starring in… I guess that’s the Gemini in me lol.
            <span class="question">What has it been like over the past 5 years for you as this movie went through an enormously long post-production period?</span>
            I have just been working in New York some but mostly Finishing college. I'm a senior at Temple University.
            <span class="question">I thought that you were the funniest character in the movie and one of the most memorable. When you first read the script, what were your first thoughts about playing a funny character like that?</span>
            Thank you! Umm I really didn’t get her humor at first it just came out that way. I just did the character the way I felt that she should be, tough but didn’t take herself too seriously (but still didn’t take no stuff).</p>

            Umm, memorable! I remember the taping of the close reaction shot. I was actually strattled (you know like a pony lol) by the director to get the shot… Aww memories lol.
            <span class="question">Anything else you would like to add about making the movie or anything?</span>
            The movie was a blast to make and I just hope the fans have a blast watching it!
