                    <p>It's a Glorious Day for Campers all across the country! The SLEEPAWAY CAMP SURVIVAL KIT is officially released TODAY!!! Check out THIS AD from the Massachusetts BEST BUY Flyer!! Look at that KILLER Price and Killer promotion for our allmighty DVD Set! Also check out SEQUEL DIRECTOR, MICHAEL SIMPSON'S Notes written for SLEEPAWAYCAMPMOVIES.COM about The DVD releases</p>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Over the last two years since James Hendsbee, the British Columbia webmaster (Sleepaway Camp Lives), first contacted me and asked for an interview about SC2&amp;3, I have greatly enjoyed corresponding with the fans of those movies.</p>
                        <p>One of the people who has been instrumental in helping to create and maintain the great Sleepaway fan base is Jeff Hayes who has consistently provided me with excellent feedback from all the campers who visit his site about what bonus extras they wanted on the dvds.  He was key to the success of the dvds and I want to thank him for all his efforts.</p>
                        <p>I worked closely with Anchor Bay and Crest National on the authoring of the SC2&amp;3 dvds and the two companies did excellent work. To bring the movies into the digital age in first-rate condition, the dvds were created from new, low contrast prints struck from the original negatives that had been stored in pristine condition at CineFilm Lab in Atlanta. This process allowed for the best possible look for the movies.</p>  
                        <p>Numerous bonus features that fans have clamored for are also on the dvds.  I believe the behind-the-scenes footage will be of particular interest.  It gives a real feel for what it was like on the set during the production of the movies. It shows rehearsals for several key scenes including the infamous Mac Truck sequence shot in downtown Atlanta for the opening of SC3.</p>  
                        <p>I'm delighted to know that a new generation of fans will now be able to enjoy these camp classics in all their rigor mortis glory.  The talented cast and crew had great fun making these movies and it's my hope that the fans will have as much enjoyment watching Angela's Sleepaway exploits.</p>
                        <p>Michael A. Simpson,<br/>

                    <p>RIFF RETURNS in today's news! That's right, SLEEPAWAY CAMP 3's favorite thug, DARYL WILCHER, is prepping a new project not only as an actor but also a screenwriter!</p>
                    <p>Our very own RIFF from SLEEPAWAY CAMP 3, Daryl Wilcher, is welcoming a return to the screen. Many of you who have read the DARYL WILCHER INTERVIEW know that Daryl currently does a lot of behind-the-camera work these days, but what some of you may not know is that Daryl is also an aspiring screenwriter! He recently completed a script entitled: "THE WISHBOX" about a magical trunk that drastically changes the lives of the people who come in contact with it. The script is a fun melding of many genres, especially comedy and fantasy, but also has strong tones of drama and action in the mix. Daryl recently shot a promotional video for "visual conception purposes" and is currently shopping the script around the industry with his friend Chet, who will direct. One of the lead roles in the film, is that of an amiable but struggling artist, which Daryl wrote for himself to play. He has always wanted to play a comedic type role, and now he's following his WISH. Below are some Brand Spanking New widescreen-photos of DARYL WILCHER from the WISH BOX Visual. Check them out and enjoy...</p>

                    <p>Felissa Rose's upcoming flick TRITE THIS WAY features an ode to our beloved SLEEPAWAY in more ways than one.</p>
                    <p>Below, director Jason Heath describes his "ode to SLEEPAWAY CAMP" in the film:</p>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>"In the film, besides having Felissa, there is an homage to SC. My favorite line in the film...."hey Angela, why you so fucked up?" one of my favorite scenes as well. Felissa, our story-teller, actually turns on the main character of our story, when she does, she addresses the camera and says" Hey Levi, why are you so fucked up?"
                        the story is a take on the old after school specials, it looks, feels, and plays like one. Demented Drama. Word.<br/>
                        it's self aware<br/>
                        it's inside out<br/>
                        hence, Trite This Way</p>
