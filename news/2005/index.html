                    I believe Judy survived the &quot;Hair Curler Incident&quot; - but not without physical scars and a NEED for payback. She knew who her attacker was and now, years later, it's JUDY TIME!<br />
                    <strong>Rick Jensen, 43, Brookfield, WI</strong><br /><br />
                    I think Judy is probably still alive because if her hair &quot;down there&quot; was as big as the hair on her head, Angela was probably just trying to singe it off.<br />
                    <strong>Patrick Work, 32, TX</strong><br /><br />
                    She survived the attack. She ended up in the burn victim's unit of the local hospital with the perverted chef. They're now married, but her husband is in jail for incest.<br />
                    <strong>Brandon Hall, 18, Munson, PA</strong><br /><br />
                    Evil never dies. Angela wanted Judy to feel the pain and humiliation that Judy caused her; she only left the curling iron up there long enough to mutilate Judy. Judy Lives!<br />
                    <strong>Joe Filippone, 19, Golden, CO</strong><br /><br />
                    Angela did not kill Judy, but punished her in the worst way - by taking away her sex. Horribly burned, no longer feeling like a &quot;real woman&quot;. Her strong sexual allure destroyed.<br />
                    <strong>James Cella, 28, Edison, NJ</strong><br /><br />
                    I think Judy didn't survive her attack because when you see her hand go up in pain and then she drops behind the bed, then the counselors say she is missing.<br />
                    <strong>Anthony Gentile, 21, Worcester, MA</strong><br /><br />
                    I think Judy should have died because Angela was jelous of her.Judy should have also gotten killed because she was a bitch and a snob. Plus her killing was Great.<br />
                    <strong>Sean Gamble, 25, Philadelphia, PA</strong><br /><br />
                    Judy was cold as ice in more ways than one, when penetrated she simply cooled down the curling iron as well as shorting out the circuit. She survived the sadistic attack.<br />
                    <strong>George S, 55, Clifton, NJ</strong><br /><br />
                    Yes, I do believe Judy died from shock. Out of all the slasher films I've ever seen no death quite compares to the famous curling iron to vagina from sleepaway camp.<br />
                    <strong>Dan Randall, 18, Apalachin, N.Y.</strong><br /><br />
                    Judy survived Angela's attack so she could come back in a future Sleepaway Camp to have a vengeful catfight with Angela. The winner will hold down the bloody Sleepaway Camp crown.<br />

                    <p>Horror fans attending the ROCK AND SHOCK Horror Convention/Concert this weekend in central Massachusetts were treated to a 1-time Sneak preview of RETURN TO SLEEPAWAY CAMP.</p>
                    <img src="/img/blank.gif" class="lazy text-right" data-original="/img/news/2005-rockshockpreview2.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Worcester, Massachusetts makes a small stab into SLEEPAWAY CAMP history On October 8, 2005. Jeff Hayes introduced the World Premiere of the RETURN TO SLEEPAWAY CAMP (first) trailer in his home city at the ROCK AND SHOCK Horror Convention.</p>
                    <p>Horror fans seemed genuinely thrilled as they watched a bunch of mean kids tormenting each other and caught glimpses at some of the film's nasty murders. Audience members asked Jeff if the film was a slasher-mystery period piece because they felt a strong 80's style horror-slasher vibe, a quality which they greatly appreciated and were thrilled to see being resurrected.</p>
                    <p>Following the trailer was a 4 minute behind-the-scenes preview, taking viewers on a brief tour of the set, hosted by original "Angela" Felissa Rose and Jeff Hayes. RETURN TO SLEEPAWAY CAMP is completing the final phases of digital post-production now, with a 2006 release to follow.</p>
                    <p>Also, Coming this week for all you festive campers: JUDY'S HALLOWEEN CONTEST! Keep your eyes peeled. One lucky winner will receive an Autographed still of Karen Fields as "Judy" in the original SLEEPAWAY CAMP.</p>
