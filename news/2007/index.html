                    <p>I received an email from Aaron at Deadpit Radio discussing a recent radio interview he did with SLEEEPAWAY 2 and 3 director Michael Simpson!</p>

                        <p>Jeff,</p>
                        <p>I just wanted to let you know that we here at Deadpit Radio recently did an audio interview with Michael A. Simpson, and it will be airing on our site tomorrow after 1:00 EST. In the interview, Michael talks about the casting of the films, the status of his 'Berserk' idea, and many other interesting factoids about the two films. The show can be downloaded or streamed from the site, and it will be available for several months in our archives after the first week. We would be thrilled if you could put a link up anywhere on your site.</p>
                        <p>Thanks for your time, and hope to hear from you.</p>

                <p>Oh, I've noticed an increase in juvenile e-mail lately trying to create a non-existent war between my site and sleepawaycampfilms.  For those of you have have nothing better to do than send me ignorant and unmerited emails, there are websites better suited for your needs <a href="http://www.sesameworkshop.org/sesamestreet">HERE...</a> I don't work on this website to listen to goofballs blame me for the delay in RTSC's release.  Those accusations are pure ignorance. I don't control the post production process.  If you don't appreciate what we're offering you here, there is a whole galaxy of other websites you can haunt.  As for the real fans, the hardcore fans, the die hards; thank you for your continued support of Sleepaway Camp!  You are the ones that make doing this website worthwhile.</p>
                <p>So, was that the biggest update ever or what? Wheww! Now maybe me and Tania can rest our fingers for a few days? I'm sure all the new content will keep you busy for a while. Sorry for the long delay, but as Aunt Martha always says: "Good things come to those who wait." And, oh yeah, there's more to come! Keep On Campin'!</p>
