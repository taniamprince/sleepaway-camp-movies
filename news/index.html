                    <p>As we begin to rock into the summer, I hope you're ready for a whole bunch of exclusive new website goodies! With the Blu-ray/DVD releases of SLEEPAWAY CAMP II and III slashing onto the scene from SCREAM FACTORY this June 9th, this summer is starting out with a double bang!</p>
                    <p>To further celebrate the releases, we are gonna take you <a href="/sleepaway-camp-3/blu-ray/behind-the-scenes/">behind the scenes</a> of the Blu Ray bonus features in Atlanta! Co-producer/webmaster Jeff Hayes has assembled a fun group of his Camp New Horizons buddies and even a "sh*t sister" from Camp Rolling Hills to recollect their camp memories for you. As a nice companion to the new documentaries on the new discs, here on the website you can catch up with crazy campers like "Riff" and snotty bigots like "Cindy"... or catch up with "Tony" (who's still dealing with some major PTSD from his nightmare at Camp New Horizions in 1989)!  And that's not all.  Head on over <a href="/sleepaway-camp-3/blu-ray/behind-the-scenes/">HERE</a> to join us behind the scenes and catch additional interview footage and lots more.</p>
                    <p>And as if those marshmellows wern't enough, SLEEPAWAY CAMP III fans are going to get the chance to SEE and HEAR some of your favorite characters in our brand new <a href="/sleepaway-camp-3/blu-ray/video-commentary/">VIDEO COMMENTARY</a> section!  Here you'll be able to watch scenes from the movies with video commentary.</p>
                    <p>We will also have some BRAND NEW contests coming soon where you can win SIGNED SLEEPAWAY CAMP II and III 8x10 promotional stills and more!</p>
                    <p><img src="/img/news/2015-contest.jpg" alt=""></p>
                    <p>We hope you have taken notice of the new website design, compliments of Tania Prince, who has made the website mobile-friendly so that you can now enjoy it to the max on your smartphones!</p>
                    <p>Finally, as an additional note, many of you have asked why Pam Springsteen was not involved on the new Blu-rays. The answer is this: We tried very hard to get her to come onboard and do an interview and commentary for all the fans, but, unfortunately, she didn't want to do it. It's saddening because all the fans wanted her on there more than anything. I'm sure she has her reasons. Some have said that perhaps she had some unresolved bad blood with specific crew from the movies and didn't want to be involved because of that. But instead of dwelling on the negative, let's enjoy everything that did happen because SLEEPAWAY CAMP II and III are being re-released on Blu-ray with fun new features!!!</p>
