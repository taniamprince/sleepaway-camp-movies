I talked with Jonathan a few nights ago and he is really excited about the new music that he and his band have been recording for their new album. Head over and give &quot;TIED UP (remix)&quot; a download! Jonathan also shared his enthusiasm about RETURNing to the screen as RICKY again...&quot;Jeff, you and I both know that the new script is twisted and it would have to be coming from that twisted mind of Robert Hiltzik! It's gonna be great when we do this and as you and I know- the fans of the first film are going to love it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>We also have a new fan tribute from JARED HALL. It's such a cool thing to see that SLEEPAWAY lures in fans of all ages! Jared here wasn't even born when the film was made! How's that for staying power?? Check his sentiments out <a href="/fandom/jared-tribute">HERE!</a></p>

                    <p>We've got some Great News for Aunt Martha fans tonight! After an almost 2-decade long hiatus from acting, SHE'S COMING BACK- No Strings attached!!! Joining into the cast which includes SLEEPAWAY'S killer camper FELISSA ROSE in the upcoming flick: UNDER SURVEILLANCE, DESIREE plays the pain-killer addicted mother of the movie's main character. sleepawaycampmovies.com's JEFF HAYES also makes a cameo in the film and shot some behind the scenes photos of DESIREE prepping and rehearsing for one of her scenes.</p>
                    <p>She was one of the craziest AUNTS ever to grace the silver screen! She gave a performance that people will never forget...and then...she vanished! Desiree Gould hasn't appeared in a movie in about 2 decades. SO you thought it was all "Water Under The Bridge" did ya?? THINK AGAIN! She re-emerged into the public eye at the SLEEPAWAY CAMP REUNION in 2001...and now she's ready to take your breath away once again...</p>

                    <p>Goooood morning Campers! Good Afternoon and Good Evening too! Yea, yea, I know, it seems like I've been slacking on the updates. It's not intentional though, trust me! I just have a LOT going on between 3 movies and an album...But let's get to some updates!</p>
                    <p>FRANK SORRENTINO Update! Frank, who played &quot;PETER&quot; in the original SLEEPAWAY CAMP has recently informed me that he is starting his very own Clothing Line!! Let's hope it's not girl's clothes made for boys! (haha- just a lil' SLEEPAWAY humor)! FRANK will be launching the website for the clothing line soon and when he does, you can read all about it right here! Also, It just came to my attention that the link to my <a href="/interviews/frank-sorrentino">Interview with Frank</a> had been broken...but it's back up now and ready to read!</p>
                    <p>We also present you with a New DARYLTOON created by SLEEPAWAY CAMP 3's Daryl &quot;RIFF&quot; Wilcher! Daryl has drawn some Cartoon art for the forthcoming GRANDMA'S SECRET RECIPE Sequel. Go to the <a href="/sleepaway-camp-3/daryl-toons">DARYLTOONS Section</a> and Check it out! In another interesting twist of SLEEPAWAY CAMP Fate...it looks as though our buddy RIFF will be following in the footsteps of Felissa &quot;ANGELA' Rose and Director Robert Hiltzik by starring in the GRANDMA Sequel! DARYL is set to play the host of an INSIDE EDITION-inspired Television program that is doing a segment on the GRANDMA House and Murders! Does RIFF have what it takes to Take on GRANDMA??</p>
                    <p>I have received FAN TRIBUTES from many of you...but many of you have not sent me a photo of yourselves to compliment your great articles... If you haven't done so, please submit a photo or 2 with your articles. Thank you! I'll get more up soon..</p>
                    <p>We will also soon have a BIG look at FELISSA ROSE'S new indie flick: TRITE THIS WAY. Well that's all for now folks...Keep On Campin' and more to come..</p>
