                    <p>RETURN TO SLEEPAWAY CAMP Executive Producer, Tom Van Dell fills us in on the composers he has lined up for the forthcoming movie. Award Winning composer Rodney Whittenberg (who supplied the score for 2002's insect shocker INFESTED) and Tony McAnany (who created music for the Oliver Stone hit: ANY GIVEN SUNDAY) will be composing a creepy soundscape for the big RETURN. Digital Effects editing is going full steam ahead with a likely Spring 2005 completion. And director Robert Hiltzik will soon be going overseas to make use of some new digital technology to incorporate.</p>

                    <p>Over a year before the debut of SLEEPAWAY CAMP 2: UNHAPPY CAMPERS, a unique little horror/comedy movie called DEADTIME STORIES assaulted movie theaters everywhere. DEADTIME features creepy Make-Up FX work by ED FRENCH, the talented artist who did all the make-up FX work on the original SLEEPAWAY CAMP. But this twisted tale has another similarity to the SLEEPAWAY CAMP series.</p>
                    <p>Of particular interest to fans of SLEEPAWAY CAMP 2: UNHAPPY CAMPERS, DEADTIME contained a sequence very similar to the "abandoned cabin" scene. Not only was our killer a homicidal female (named Goldi Lox) but she also kept decomposing corpses stored in an old "abandoned" house. I encourage fans of SLEEPAWAY 2 to check out DEADTIME, if you haven't already seen it, as the tone in the "Goldi Lox" tale has some cool similarities.</p>
                    <img src="/img/news/2004-deadtime.jpg" class="text-left" alt="">
                    <p>After I tracked down Jeffrey S. Delaman (the director of DEADTIME) and worked with him to get a DVD release going for the film, I had him put me in touch with Goldi Lox herself: Cathryn De Prume. Cathryn filled me in on everything from DEADTIME to what she is doing now. Then I did a phone interview with her so all the DEADTIME fans could read up on what she's been up to. I sent the interview over to the cool cats at ICONSOFFRIGHT.COM who were pleased to feature it for their interview craving horror fans.</p>

                    <h2>Freak13 Press Release</h2>
                    <p>The character Angela from Sleepaway Camp did not have much to say in the infamous film. But Felissa Rose, the talented and beautiful actress who played the character, cannot contain her excitement about the (double) debut cd FEAR NO EVIL, from Texas-based metal band FREAK13.<br /><br />&quot;Finally a band really gets putting horror and metal together. They are just an amazing band,&quot; Rose said at their July 31 cd release party in Beaumont, TX.<br /><br />&quot;One of the two discs in this set is all based in horror so we thought if we were going to do a cd release party it was only right to bring out some of the horror icons we grew up with,&quot; said band leader Chester Moore.<br /><br />&quot;Not only did we get the awesome Felissa Rose, but we got Jason (CJ Graham) as well as Lar Park Lincoln, &quot;Tina&quot; from Friday the 13th 7: The New Blood.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;It was awesome having them come out to celebrate our release and party with us in the Lone Star State,&quot; he added. The band also got a special bonus as Ed Neal, the hitchhiker from the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, showed up to help celebrate the event after Felissa told him of it.<br /><br />&quot;Looking over and seeing that guy there was mind-blowing. We are all huge Texas Chainsaw Massacre fans. It made the weekend even more exciting,&quot; said FREAK13 co-vocalist Raven.<br /><br />FREAK13's first single from FEAR NO EVIL, &quot;Crystal Lake&quot; is tearing up the Soundlick Internet charts, peaking at number two and it has stayed in the top 10 for three weeks.<br /><br />&quot;There are 1,100 metal bands on that chart and a quite a few are signed. It's awesome to know we're getting that kind of support because we believe in this music unconditionally,&quot; Moore said.<br /><br />The band plan to release the single for &quot;Angela&quot;, the Sleepaway Camp based song later this fall. To download &quot;Crystal Lake&quot; or to buy FEAR NO EVIL, go to www.freak13.net.<br /><br />FEAR NO EVIL is a double cd package featuring 20 new studio songs from FREAK13 as well as three bonus tracks.<br /><br />Disc one, Beneath the Skin, contains the following tracks: Bitter End, New Orleans, The Demon In Me, October Sin, Jackal's Daughter, The Raven, Will-O-Wisp, Bragg Road, Texas Power Trip.<br />*Bonus Tracks: Broken Circle, Black Widow<br /><br />Disc two, Drive-In Massacre, is based all on horror movies with songs about films ranging from Friday the 13th to the Creature from the Black Lagoon.<br /><br />The tracklisting is as follows: Blackwater, Believe In me, Crystal Lake, Rodan, Scream Queen, The Hills Have Eyes, Curse of Thorn, Angela, Paint Me Red, Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things.<br />*Bonus Track: Jack-O-Lantern</p>

                    <p>Catch a FELISSA "Angela" ROSE appearance at the CD Release party for Metal Monsters: FREAK13 on Saturday, July 31. The band features a song on their new disc called "Angela" based upon a character from SLEEPAWAY CAMP that you all know and love. If you're gonna be in TX with some time to KILL, go catch up with FREAK13 and some horror movie icons! Here's the press release: The Monster Metal Kings FREAK13 have announced Sat. July 31 as the release date from their new double studio cd FEAR NO EVIL. To celebrate the release, they have teamed up with Jason Voorhees himself, CJ Graham, from Friday the 13th: Jason Lives. "One of the two discs in this set is all based in horror so we thought if we were going to do a cd release party it was only right to bring out some of the horror icons we grew up with," said Chester Moore.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We've got Jason (CJ Graham) as well as two of the coolest and most beautiful horror characters to ever hit the screen, Felissa Rose, Angela from Sleepaway Camp and Lar Park Lincoln, Tina from Friday the 13th 7: The New Blood. This is going to be an awesome show,&quot; he added.

                    <p>As mentioned previously, Paul "Ronnie" DeAngelo is working on post-production for his directorial debut: DESTINATION FAME. The flick was not only directed by your favorite man in the red jogging suit but was also written by him as well...and he has a cool role in it too! Move over Mel Gibson! Ronnie's takin' over! It's the heartfelt tale of kids trying to make it in the tough music industry. Fellow Camper: Felissa Rose has a role in the film as the mother of the main character (played by American Idol's A.J. Gil) and Webmaster Jeff did some publicist work for the upcoming film.</p>
                    <p>You can check out a bunch of stills from the movie and get a more detailed synopsis <a href="http://www.destinationfamethemovie.com">HERE!!!</a> Check it out!! ...And yes, I know you are waiting for more RETURN TO SLEEPAWAY pics... have no FEAR, there's more to come...soon...</p>
