                    <h2>Updates on RETURN TO SLEEPAWAY CAMP release</h2>
                    <p>How many years has it been now? Oh yeah, now I remember. How could I forget with all the reminders from SLEEPAWAY fans? Don't worry, I'm getting all your messages and I agree with you completely - it's time to see this movie released. Well, rumor has it that we're finally looking at release THIS YEAR. Supposedly the scoring has been worked out and a finished movie is on the horizon. But in the words of director Robert Hiltzik, "Don't count your chickens before they hatch!" Robert is still a bit bamboozled with the CGI fiasco and apparently it hasn't yet been exactly worked out to his satisfaction. What exactly does this mean? It means ... Until you get the official word, take everything with a grain of salt. A lot of you have noted conflicting reports. This guy is saying "this" and that guy is saying "that," but we've heard it all before. As many of you know, that is why I stopped updating every time somebody gets a nibble that usually just leads right back to the same ole circle. But I promise you one thing: as soon as I get the official word from Robert, I'll let you all know.</p>
