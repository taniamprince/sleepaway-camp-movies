            <p><span class="heading">AINT IT COOL NEWS has posted an Early Review of RETURN TO SLEEPAWAY CAMP</span>
            You can check it out <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/38559">HERE</a>. Executive Producer, Tom Van Dell, reacting to some of the early reviews laughed.  "It's funny how these early reviews mention that they didn't see much or any CGI, which held up the film, because, in fact most of the death scenes contained CGI.  If people haven't noticed that, it's a huge credit to the CGI crew for doing such an extraordinary job!"</p>

            <p><span class="heading">HOLY MOLY: AN UPDATE!</span>
            Yes, I have received all your e-mails and YES, an update is long overdue. Why the long delay? Unfortunately, the original CGI AFTER-EFFECTS were not up to snuff. Director, Robert Hiltzik and Executive Producer, Tom Van Dell were not satisfied with the results and all the work was Scrapped! Ouch!! As if you all hadn't been waiting long enough. Then the hunt was on for a new FX Team to start-from-scratch yet again for all the digital compositing and bring everything up to spec.</p>
            <p>Yet another delay... but Now, it's FINALLY finishing. Executive Producer, Tom Van Dell says that the new 10-man team of CGI FX artists are hard at work every day finishing up the eagerly awaited sequel. Van Dell is also optimistic about a possible FAll Theatrical release! So hold on to your camp hats because we should (finally) have some big announcements to make by Summer's End. And yes, we have lots of RTSC featurettes coming to the website, so have no fear, the light is near... </p>

            <p>Many of you have been asking for the RETURN TO SLEEPAWAY CAMP PLOT...  As many of you know, RETURN is fashioned as another mysterious "Who-Done-It," much like the original film. There's LOTS of characters, LOTS of suspects, and LOTS of speculation! So many of you have said over the years how you loved the "speculation" behind the original...  Well, that "speculation" is back with a vengeance! Was it Mr. Hiltzik with the Beehive in the Rec Hall? Or maybe Mrs. Voorhess with the knife in the outhouse? Only time will tell...  but in the meantime, get out your list, "Knock off" a few suspects, and Check out your <a href="/return-to-sleepaway-camp/promotion/plot/">PLOT</a> right here!!</p>

            ahh, yes, those elaborate digital fx. Now that a rough cut of RTSC has been completed, the next phase of the project is implementing the digital fx. Now, I know some of you are saying- SLEEPAWAY CAMP, digital fx? What's up with that? So let me ease your mind. The digital fx are being used to enhance some of the already creative murders. And don't worry, we're not talking about blocky computerized blood. We're talking about taking some of these murders and giving them even more "sting!" And again, have no fear, this doesn't mean the make-up fx is phased out whatsoever. The digital stuff is being used to enhance what is already there and in some cases, show some of what Robert has conjured up that can't be done with make-up. Yes, you certainly have some cool and creepy visuals coming your way! So that's where we're at folks... It's coming along... We're looking forward to sending you all back to camp.</p>

            Hey there Campers! We have now completed week 5 and things are still 'sailing along' just great! We have made our transition into night shooting and the cast and crew continue to pump out an amazing movie. There's nothing quite like being in the woods of SLEEPAWAY CAMP just after midnight. We have shot some more death sequences that will keep campers talking for years! Sorry for the delay in updating but we've all been busy campers! So lock your cabin doors; sit back and enjoy some more exclusive photos from on the set of RETURN TO SLEEPAWAY CAMP...</p>

            <p><span class="heading">Week 2 Update!!!</span>
            Howdy Campers! Well we have completed week 2 and the movie is rolling along just great! Some of the week's highlights included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the arrival of Jonathan Tiersten, RETURNING as RICKY</li>
                <li>We shot the first death sequence (and you guys are gonna LOVE it! SLEEPAWAY is known for it's innovative murders and this is certainly NO Exception)</li>
                <li>We lost power for a bunch of hours one evening due to the hurricane and got to eat our supper in the dark next to a campfire. All the Pizza you could eat and all the beer you could drink! Now that's Campin'!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Popular fan question of the week was:
            <div class="panel">
                <span class="heading">IS THIS MOVIE GOING TO BE RATED PG?</span>
                Have you ever seen a PG rated SLEEPAWAY CAMP??? Exactly! So Don't believe everything you hear unless you read it here. You have NOTHING to worry about... this movie is just as wild and gruesome as any other SLEEPAWAY... actually Even More!!! So you can throw the rumors away in the camp trash...</p>
            </div>
            <p>And now, here's your EXCLUSIVE look Behind-The-Scenes of WEEK 2! Camp is coming back!!</p>

            <p><span class="heading">Howdy Campers!! Greetings from SLEEPAWAY CAMP!</span>
            We have completed week 1 of filming and week 2 begins tomorrow. It has been an exciting experience watching Robert's wild script come to life before the camera. Felissa and I have been having a blast shooting some Behind-The-Scenes footage and also working on various production details.</p>
            <figure class="text-right">

                <figcaption>Felissa and Jeff on the set of RETURN TO SLEEPAWAY CAMP</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p><span class="heading">Now to answer many of your questions surrounding the RETURN:</span>
            RETURNING cast members include PAUL DeANGELO as RONNIE. Paul and I had lunch on Sunday before he went on set to shoot his first scene. He's as cool as ever!! Yep-The MAN is back... and once again providing his own wardrobe. He hasn't pulled out a red jogging suit yet, but if he does, I'll be sure to let you all know. JONATHAN TIERSTEN is also RETURNing as RICKY. He still has a bit of a potty mouth and definitely isn't afraid to use it. Jonathan shoots this week. Other cast will include VINCENT PASTORE (THE SOPRANOS, THE HURRICANE) and ISAAC HAYES (who played THE DUKE in ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and is also the voice of CHEF on SOUTH PARK). Lots of Stunning FX are being created and the RETURN is gonna be worth the wait! As for Felissa RETURNing as "Angela," anything is possible! In other news, LORIS SALLAHIAN (BILLY) unfortunately couldn't get on board the project due to his hectic schedule with a new clothing line he is working on. However, his replacement is doing an amazing job nonetheless. For those of you who have tried to e-mail me; unfortunately my e-mail access is limited up here at camp (and I haven't been able to go through a lot of it yet) but I will get back to you as soon as I can.</p>
            <p>So Campers, until next update, Stay Cool and get ready to RETURN TO SLEEPAWAY. We're bringing it back and it's going to be a wild ride!!!</p>

            <h1 class="news">September 10, 2003</h1>
            <p><span class="heading">YUP - It's HAPPENING!</span>
            Sorry it took so long to get an update on this project out to everyone! We've all been working really hard behind-the-scenes to get this movie going. We didn't want to post anything until we had everything locked into place... but now we do, and it's time to reignite the campfire!!! I know I have received e-mails from many of you asking if this movie was ever going to happen OR if it was a "Publicity Stunt" because that is what you had read on some silly website... Whoever concocted that story must have been smoking some of what Kenny and Mike shared under the boathouse. People who have no involvement with the project seem to love creating rumors... but as Aunt Martha always says "That's water under the bridge" now! All washed up. I know you have all been waiting a LONG time to hear this news... well you can break out the marshamallows my fellow campers, because IT'S ON and we're RETURNing TO SLEEPAWAY CAMP!!!</p>
            <p>More details to come...</p>
